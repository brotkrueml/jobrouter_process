Surely you want to execute the commands regularly. Simply set up cron jobs that
will execute the commands regularly, e.g. once an hour or once a day, depending
on your needs.

.. _command-start:

Starting instances
------------------

If you rely on the :ref:`form finisher <form-finisher>` or use the
:ref:`transfer table <developer-start-instance>` directly to start
instances in JobRouterÂ® installations, you have to use the start command:

::

   vendor/bin/typo3 jobrouter:process:start

In general you should receive a successful answer:

.. code-block:: text

   [OK] 18 transfer(s) started successfully

If an error occurs, the command issues a warning:

.. code-block:: text

   [WARNING] 4 out of 11 incident(s) had errors on start

Other process starts are not affected by an error in one start. According
to your :ref:`logging configuration <configuration-extension>`, the error is
also logged.

.. note::
   Only one start command can run at a time. If the command starts while
   another is in progress, the second command is terminated and a warning
   is displayed.

The last run of the command is shown in the system information toolbar
(:guilabel:`Last Instance Start`):

.. _command-cleanuptransfers:

Clean up transfers
------------------

After successfully starting instances from the transfer table, these transfers
are marked as successful. They may contain sensitive data and should be deleted
regularly. A command is available for this task:

::

   vendor/bin/typo3 jobrouter:process:cleanuptransfers

In general you should receive a successful answer:

.. code-block:: text

   [OK] 42 successful transfers older than 30 days deleted

By default, successful transfer records that are older than 30 days are deleted.
You can adjust this value by adding an argument to the command:

.. code-block:: text

   vendor/bin/typo3 jobrouter:process:cleanuptransfers 7

Now successful transfer records that are older than seven days are deleted. If
you use `0` as argument, all successful transfers are deleted.

.. important::
   Erroneous transfer entries are not deleted and must be handled manually.

.. note::
   If there were deleted successful transfer records, the number of affected
   rows is logged as *notice*, if there were none it is logged as *info*.

.. note::
   The number of days is also taken into account for the :ref:`Dashboard widgets
   <dashboard-widgets>`.
